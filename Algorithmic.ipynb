    "Given `n` entrances, `m` students and `g` guards, we have to implement an algorithm that check if the current number of guards is enough to monitor the flow of students while abiding by the following restrinctions:\n",
    "- the entrance must be opened right before the first studentâ€™s arrival and closed right after the arrival of the last student that should enter through that specific entrance;\n",
    "- two students can not enter the university simultaneously;\n",
    "- for an entry to be protected, a guard should be assigned to it;\n",
    "- a guard cannot leave his post until the door he was given is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task: tell if, given the input, the guards will survail the entarances abiding the above rules."
